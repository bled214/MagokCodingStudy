martin.yang : https://clist.by/coder/martin0327/

<Online CP platforms:>
* Codeforces : most authoritative
* AtCoder : having most interesting problems
* CodeChef : having many Indians
<Major Contests:>
* Topcoder Open, Google Code Jam, Meta Hacker Cup, AtCoder World Tour Finals (for grown ups)
Hyundai Mobis Algorithm Competition, Hello BOJ, Grand Arena Party (for Koreans)
ICPC (for college students)
SCPC, LGCPC (for koreans)
Olympiad in Informatics (for secondary school students)
NYPC (for Koreans)

<What is LG Codejam?>
started as an internal CP contest
gradually became more like a coding test that assesses one's problem solving skills 
absolute evaluation: your rank does not matter at all
need to score 70/ 100 (essentially 3 out of 4 problems)
If you pass the exam, you become a certified SW coding expert

<Any measure of difficulties?>
solved.ac provides the difficulty tier of problems from BOJ based on user votings
AtCoder Problems provides the difficulty index of problems from AtCoder based on contest data
CF Tracker provides the difficulty index of problems from Codeforces based on contest data
How challenging is LG Codejam?
Qual round generally requires DSA knowledge up to 'solved.ac Platinum3' or 'CF 2100~2300'
including topics like 'network flow'
final round generally requires CP competence equivalent to 'CF1400~1600' and knowledge up to 'solved.ac Platinum5'
<Recommended Contests:>
For beginners:
LeetCode Weekly / Biweekly Contests
AtCoder Beginner Contests
Codeforces Div.3/4

<Use template (library)>
Focus on how to solve.
You can learn internals later.
Run before you can walk

<What if using template is prohibited? it's time to cram (smile)>
C++ is the de-facto standard language
has a built-in BBST
fast (not an important factor in LG Codejam)
has more references than any other language
